# Proposal 001: Initial Project Setup and GitHub Integration

## Date
October 5, 2025

## Author

## Objective
Get the hworld project off the ground by syncing it to GitHub and integrating GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. This will establish a solid foundation for development, collaboration, and automated workflows.

## Background
The hworld project is a new initiative focused on building tools in a Unix-inspired way, emphasizing Python classes, clean code practices, and self-contained utilities. The project is currently initialized in a local git repository but needs to be connected to GitHub for version control and CI/CD.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Create a README.md file with project description, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- Add a .gitignore file tailored for Python projects to exclude unnecessary files.
- Ensure all files follow project conventions: 4-space indentation, CamelCase naming, double quotes, 79-character line limits.

### 2. GitHub Actions Integration
- Create a workflow file in .github/workflows/ for automated testing and linting.
- Configure the workflow to run on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.
- Include steps for Python environment setup, dependency installation, linting, and basic testing.

### 3. Repository Synchronization
- Commit all initial files to the local git repository.
- Provide instructions for creating a GitHub repository and pushing the code.
- Set up branch protection rules and other GitHub features as needed.

## Benefits
- Enables collaborative development through GitHub.
- Automates code quality checks via GitHub Actions.
- Establishes version control best practices from the start.
- Provides a clear project structure for future contributions.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create proposal document (this file).
2. Implement basic project files (README.md, .gitignore).
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow.
4. Commit changes and prepare for GitHub push.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: GitHub repository creation requires manual steps.
  - Mitigation: Provide clear instructions for the user.
- Risk: Workflow failures due to missing dependencies.
  - Mitigation: Start with minimal workflow and expand as project grows.

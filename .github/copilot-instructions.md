# Project Conventions
-) current workflow:
   1. create a proposal in .github/proposals/
   2. implement changes following project conventions
   3. update the changelog
   4. submit a pull request

-) Guidelines for Proposals
    - proposals should start every section with a checkbox.
    - proposals should be execututed using the checkboxes. mark them as you go.
    - proposals should be general and architectural.
    - proposals should not be about specific code changes.

-) Guidelines for Github
    - maintain all new proposals in commit. 1 commit per proposal.
    - always start to execute a proposal from an unchanged committed state.
